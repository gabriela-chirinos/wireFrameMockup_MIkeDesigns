## 📚 About The Project

**Go Mike Designs** is a static website built as part of my early front-end development journey. The goal was to create a fictional web designer's portfolio, targeting businesses in **Atlanta**, GA. This project was designed to practice:

- Structuring content with **semantic HTML**

- Applying **Bootstrap** for responsive layouts

- Incorporating basic **SEO techniques** to improve discoverability

- Experimenting with call-to-actions (CTAs) to encourage user engagement

The project acted as a **sandbox for practicing real-world skills** like web design principles, responsive grids, and foundational search engine optimization (SEO).
